        <p>MYS cracked the egg on the edge of the bowl and split it just right, watching the yolk fall into the bowl. Arial takes the mixture into her arms, whisking the bowl before bumping Amjamis, who is spacing off with her hips. He jolted awake “Huh- ah, oh..” He groans. Amjamis goes over to the oven and turns it on. Arial places the bowl into MYS’ arms who starts meticulously scraping every bit of the cake batter into the cake pan, Arial cleans the table, opening up the oven as one of MYS’ strings slots the cake into the oven. “This is gonna be delicious!” MYS exclaims. Amjamis looked at the knife. Arial sits at the table, MYS joining her before asking “Hey, Mr. Corpse. Gonna stand there like an NPC the entire time, or are you gonna actually conversate?” Amjamis as he limps forward slowly, but not toward them. “Amjamis, is everything alright?” Arial asks. Amjamis slightly whispers, “I saw someone do this before..” Before grabbing the knife and stabbing the ground. “Someone’s gone psych-” MYS gets interrupted as light protrudes from the ground. “Amjamis, what are you doing?!” Arial screams, trying to stop Amjamis, but he doesn’t budge. The light spreads into the room further, coating everything. The light blinds the room, the world, the universe.</p>

        <p>The church bell rings loudly, the noise bouncing off the walls. It never stops. The bell tolls back and forward over, and over, and over again. Amjamis stands before the tall figure. It stares at him with a sad expression, despite the fact it has no face. It’s almost judging Amjamis in real time, and is coming to no final conclusion. There’s too much information, it’s overwhelming. Amjamis slightly chuckles to himself. “Hey, don’t worry old-timer. Don’t gotta rush yourself.” The figure seems offended by Amjamis’ words. Amjamis steps forward. “Besides, you’ve got a hell of alot more than those few measly years to look through.” The figure leans down to face Amjamis, intrigued. “You’ve tried your best, but it takes a hell of alot more than that to kill me.” Amjamis spreads his arms wide. “Fucking try me.” It takes a large step back as Amjamis takes a small step forward. “Try me! C’mon! Is that all you got!? A couple of gunshots and stab wounds!? A disease!? I’ve dealt with so much worse, you can’t even compare.” The figure revolts into the altar, hiding away before Amjamis opens his left eye.</p>

        <p>“Mmn, comfy corpse!” MYS cheers gleefully as he lays on Amjamis’ chest. Amjamis yawns awake, pushing MYS off and limping his way around before realizing.. “Oh, son of a fucking bitch..” He says as MYS looks around. “What? Did you forget to pray today?” The church was massive, columns of seats, an upper level, all staring at one singular stand. “Oh, boy, this is like a more humble megachurch.” MYS said. Amjamis mutters a curse before kicking a cardboard cutout of a sheep softly, picking MYS up and placing him on his back. “Stay hidden within my shadow. I don’t wanna deal with these people seeing or knowing what you are.” Amjamis says as MYS shrugs before hiding within Amjamis’ shadow as they leave the church, looking for Arial.</p>

        <p>They heard a commotion outside, screams of terror and worry. “Well, if Arial had to be anywhere..” Amjamis said, going towards the sound as MYS continues, “You know how she always likes to help those who don’t even deserve it.” Amjamis smiles slightly, saying “Are you referring to me.. Or you?” MYS smiles even bigger in return. “Who said I was just talking about us?” They make it to the sound, seeing Arial cushioning a man as he seizes on the ground intensely. “Everyone! Give him space!” Arial yells, waving her arms around, trying to make people disperse, she slightly glances up, catching Amjamis and MYS in her sight. “Guys! Get over here!” Amjamis slowly walks over, kneeling down, staring at him with no visible emotion. “Well, that definitely makes this alot more interesting.” He says as Arial lightly hits him. “No time for jokes! We need to help him!” Amjamis gets up, yelling. “Anyone got a hospital?! Y’know, uh.. In your pockets? Like.. Maybe down the street? Or a clinic at your Walmart?” Arial groans loudly, holding the man close as he slowly stops seizing. Amjamis looks at Arial, sarcastically remarking, “I think we’ve came to the town of mutes.” Arial snaps back at him, “They’re watching a man seize in front of them- they’re not desensitized and rude like you..!” Amjamis shrugs, as MYS teasingly says, “She’s got a point!” Amjamis lets out a feigned scoff.</p>

        <p>A woman slowly walks forward. “W-we have a hospital, but we definitely don’t have enough resources to deal with.. Whatever this is..” Amjamis looks at her with a slightly annoyed expression. “Well, alright.. Any idea on what caused this?” She speaks up, “N-no! We were doing an outdoor sermon and he just.. Collapsed! Suddenly!” Amjamis asks, “And.. Who are you?” The woman responds, “My name is Esther. I am the lead nun of our church-” Amjamis interrupts her, “Yeah, yeah, I didn’t ask for your occupation.” Amjamis hotels the bridge of his nose like he’s got a headache before someone else approaches, a man. “And where did you two come from!?” Amjamis, with his hands in his pockets scoffs. “Hm? Me? Just hangin’ around.” Esther continues, “Usually.. People can’t get in or out.. And if someone somehow finds their way in.. They’re not as in shape or healthy as you two seem to be..” Amjamis tilts his head slightly. “And why would that be?” He asks. She gestures around the outer circle of the town which is encased in trees. “There’s.. Things. In the woods. They don’t like people..” Arial gasps as the man starts to wake. “Oh, my..” Amjamis leans forward, and into the man’s view. “God?” Arial lets the man’s head rest onto the ground before grabbing Amjamis’ arm hard, whispering into his ear. “Amjamis, you’re a dick. Big time, major asshole, but you seem to be really hounding these people.” She looks at him directly in the eyes. “Why?” Amjamis smiles. “Have you taken a good look at this place? Church the size of an apartment complex. The cinema only playing religious movies. An outdoor sermon.” Arial’s eyebrow raises. “So, what? You hate these people because they’re religious?” Amjamis slightly laughs while continuing to whisper. “Not because they’re religious inherently.. But because this is definitely some cult shit..” Arial looks at him wearily. “But go on, Arial.. Trust these people. Watch what happens.” He separates himself from her hold, shouting. “Alright, everyone! Go back to your churches and Bible studies! We’re going to do some investigating! Now, who owns this place?!” Arial carries the man and goes with Esther to the hospital as a man approaches Amjamis.<br><br>Amjamis’ takes a step back. He stares at the man with an intense look in his eyes. He cocks his head to the right, his ear almost twitching. The man looks at him slightly confused before introducing himself. “My name is Jesus-” Amjamis fake-laughs under his breath, snapping back to his usual, and normal-er self.. “I know.. Very ironic.” Amjamis rolls his eyes, lazily extending his hand out. “Amjamis. Amjamis Jane Frazier.” The man shakes his hand before stating, “I’m sure you could tell that this town here is one of belief and religion, however.. Those beasts in the woods have been causing quite the problem as of late.” Amjamis stretches lazily. “Cool, uh.. So.. We help your guy, you give me some food and we can leave?” The man responds, “Wait, you’re helping Abraham?” Amjamis was starting to notice the pattern in the people’s names quickly. “Well, Arial is. The girl. I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for her.. And kinda myself. Long story. Either way, it was.. I met you. I’m gonna go follow Arial.” Amjamis quickly starts walking away, feeling Jesus’ eyes on him. “I don’t trust that guy..” MYS’ voice was almost like a growl, his face grimaced as Amjamis’ face twitched. “Me neither.. Keep an eye on him..” MYS nodded, becoming a black puddle of darkness on the ground staying hidden, keeping an eye out.</p>

        <p>“So.. Church stops for a bite, decides to get some fresh air and have a nice little groupie outdoors, and then.. A guy suddenly collapses. Is that the story, doc?” Amjamis looks at Arial with a makeshift head mirror Amjamis made for her. She has an expression of tiredness, not from the situation, but from Amjamis. “Basically..” Amjamis looks down at the man who can barely speak, who can barely move. His eyes widen as Amjamis’ pierces through his. “If you’re praying for a cure right now.. You better stop it.” Arial pushes Amjamis away from him, “Amjamis, stop it.” Amjamis smiles, Arial flinches. “You should really think about who..” He slightly laughs to himself, getting up, his posture now completely straight. “I think I should go check out this ‘food’ they had. Don’t you think?” Arial, shaking, nods. Amjamis limps out of the hospital, almost walking like a corpse whose bones are all being restricted.<br><br>Amjamis walks into the church, seeing MYS on the Jesus statue's arm, slightly nuzzling Jesus’ cheek. “Oh, sweet Jesus. Tell me your lovely secrets. How do you control the world the way you do?” Amjamis laughs. “You think he’s the one who controls people?” MYS thinks for a moment. “Yeah, you’re right. This guy is dead. People control people!” He flings off the statue, landing onto Amjamis’ back. “Did you find anything?” MYS shakes his head, responding, “He seems to be.. Pretty normal- well, as normal as a guy like him can be.” Amjamis’ eyebrows furrow, and he starts inspecting the food. Some vegetables and fruits, most likely home-grown. Some meat, cleanly cut slabs, cooked all the way through, burnt even to a point on some.. They’re all the right colors, and there is no obvious showing of mold or rot. MYS perks up, “What if it’s not in the food.. But on it?” MYS gestures to the kitchen. “You think someone poisoned the guy?” MYS giggles. “It’s a cult. Crazy crap happens.” He nods, running into the kitchen making sure to note every dish in the sink, the spices, cupboards, secret stash locations like behind the stove or microwave, underneath tiles. They find nothing. “It could be some sort of natural poison.. Like a mushroom or something that they seared onto the meat to only poison a specific part of it and got rid of..” MYS takes in Amjamis’ words before snapping. “Or.. Better yet, they just brought the poison home.” Amjamis smiles at MYS. “That’s what we’d do.” MYS giggles. “That’s what we did.” Amjamis grabs MYS’ hand, flipping him onto his back and running out of the church. Behind them, the statue almost seemed to be.. Sad.</p>

        <p>Amjamis was walking through town, finding the homing sector before being stopped by Esther. “Hey! Amjamis!” Amjamis stops, only turning his head to her. “What?” Esther excitedly asks, “Arial told me about your prowess when it comes to technology!” Amjamis almost flinched back. “‘Prowess’? She really likes to overstate my abilities-” Esther continues, “We’ve been having a problem with our lighthouse and thought you could fix it.” Amjamis scratches the back of his head. “I’ve been better with, like, computers n’ stuff, not..” He stopped himself. Smiled. Then continued. “But I’ve had alot of wiring practice over the years. How may I be of help?” Esther guided him to the lighthouse, going inside to see the inner workings. “We’ve had it for years, although we've been upgrading it with newer tech. I think we’ve messed something up though, haha..” Amjamis asks, “Who’s in charge of the lighthouse? Who comes here? Checks up on stuff?” Esther points at the light, minimal decor. “Now it’s Abraham, actually. It used to be Jesus but he was working on church renovations and had Abraham take over. Apparently, Abraham enjoyed it so much, he asked to have the job permanently.” Amjamis looked at the glass, seeing MYS in the reflection. Amjamis smiled even wider. MYS smiled back. He heard MYS’ voice in the back of his head. “Now.. Nobody likes their job. At least.. Not for any of the good reasons.”</p>

        <p>Arial sits down with Jesus. “Still, there isn’t anything else I should know?” Arial asks as Jesus sighs, going from the empty frame that used to hold a pistol, to looking outside his window. “This town has some issues, yes. But nothing like a viral infection or anything like that! People here are as healthy and happy as I can keep them. I think I’ve been doing a good job- I hope I’ve been doing a good job..” Arial looks out at the town with him. “I haven’t been here long, but I can see that the people here are truly happy. I know how hard it can be leading a whole group of people.” Jesus looks at her, almost confused. “Really?” Arial nods, laughing softly. Jesus asks, “Well, from one leader to another.. Do you have any advice?” Arial looks out at the lighthouse. “Honestly, if you wanted true, unbridled advice that could change everything.. I know someone you should ask.” Jesus looks at her, slightly confused before his eyes widen in realization. “I can tell he’s.. A good man, more or less. But can I really trust him?” Jesus asks. Arial says, “That’s the thing, you can never fully trust him.” She giggles. “You just.. Have faith. Most of the time, he doesn’t even do what needs to be done for the greater good.. He just does it because he wants to.” Her smile slightly fades. “However, I did say most of the time. He’s still a person, he’s not perfect. He still has his beliefs and systems on how things should or should not go.” Jesus looks at her, understanding.<br><br>Amjamis looked around the lighthouse. Some old candy wrappers, a makeshift comfy looking bed. Nothing too out of the norm. As Esther waits outside, Amjamis looks around before looking around his wardrobe. Normal clothing. Shirts, coats, pants, etc. MYS investigated the light, not noticing anything hidden in it, or in the mechanisms. Amjamis coughs slightly, having to hold onto the desk. MYS looks at Amjamis before continuing his investigation. “Can’t find anything out here. Any luck, Mr. Corpse?” MYS says. Amjamis calls out, “Nope. Some old candy, but I highly doubt he’d get something from it.” MYS flies onto Amjamis’ back. “Don’t you think we’d find something at his house?” Amjamis looks around a little more. “There.. Has to be something here. I know it. Something about his illness.. Or about whatever the hell is going on here..” Amjamis keeps rummaging around before finding some blueprints for the lighthouse. Amjamis tilts his head slightly, inspecting the pages. “What’d you find, Mr. Corpse?” He asks, seeing Amjamis smile. “Whoever made this apparently has no idea what they’re doing..” MYS’ eyebrow raised. Amjamis shows the papers to MYS, saying “It’s completely nonsensical. Diameters don’t make sense, that’s not that’d be laid out- that’s completely different to how the roof is..” MYS looks at him, still confused. “I’m saying that this lighthouse.. Didn’t come from here.” MYS cackles. “Y’think they asked Jesus really nicely?” Amjamis smiled, looking out at the main church. “No.. But I’m not completely refusing the idea of help from below.” MYS finds a star on a singular page before smiling even wider. “Wait.. Amjamis. This one.” MYS points to a piece of paper, Amjamis picks it up, his eyes widening. “What in the..”</p>

        <p>“Your cosmic eyes fill me with wonder, and your loving voice makes me feel like I matter. For every step you take back into the darkness, that’s another piece of my soul succumbing to sadness. You leave a taste of pennies in my mouth, has it really only been a month?”<br><br>MYS revolts. “What the heck are we reading?” Amjamis shrugs, also revolted. “I have no fucking clue..”<br><br>“My hands tremble in your presence, your warmth too much for my essence. A gust of air gets caught in my throat, I’m glad you’re there to warm me like a coat.”<br><br>Amjamis sighs, “This is.. Absolutely awful.” MYS shakes his head disapprovingly. “I’m a kid and I could write better than this..”<br><br>“To you, I dedicate my life. My being. My mind. Although we may never meet for my sins, I am glad to see you every chance I get. - Abraham.”<br><br>MYS sighs. “Y’know.. I think you were right, Amjamis. Humanity is doomed.” Amjamis drops the paper. “Hey, that was only.. The 2nd worst thing we’ve ever read in our life.” MYS shudders. “I.. Say we just go to his house to investigate..” Amjamis throws his hands up half-hazardly. “Yeah. Let’s hope we don’t find any more writings of Abraham.”</p>

        <p>Amjamis walks out into the town before being stopped by Jesus. “Hey! Amjamis!” He says happily. Amjamis turns around slowly, his nose twitching. “Jesus.” Amjamis sees Abraham catch up. “Hey.. Whoo! Thank you for saving me, Amjamis.” Amjamis shrugs. “This isn’t even me downplaying myself, I haven’t done shit.” Abraham chuckles nervously. “Well- uh.. I know, but you’ve been trying to look for the cause, right?” Amjamis nods slowly. “Yeah.” A silence rings between the 3 men before Jesus asks, “Have you found any leads?” Amjamis smiles. “I found out Abraham is a shitty writer.” Abraham’s skin goes pale, he starts slightly trembling, looking like a dejected child. “Uh- that wasn’t meant for you!” Amjamis smiles again, saying “Well, the man it’s directed to,” Amjamis points up into the sky. “Doesn’t exist either.” He says as Jesus gestures, almost as if he’s trying to cut through the tension. “Hey, we all have different world views and opinions, that’s okay.” Jesus says as Amjamis’ smile widens and responds, “Is it now?” Jesus nods nervously, making Amjamis say “Is that why everyone in this heavenly community of yours is named after people in the Bible and have about the same amount of personality as my last sneeze?” Jesus’ face faltered a moment before steadying himself, calmly saying “Amjamis, I don’t think-” Abraham interrupts. “Well, you’re a bit rude.” Amjamis covers his mouth, pretending to be offended. “Oh, well, what made you think that? I should write you an apology letter! You should really take some notes.” Amjamis says, almost leaning closer before Jesus leans closer, getting in between them before explaining “Arial told me that you’d be.. Mean. You’re not getting a reaction out of me, I am not sacrificing lambs or children secretly, and there is no secret plot for you to find out. We’re devoted Christians who love our faith and that is it.” Amjamis’ eyes slowly dragged into his. Jesus couldn’t help but look away a little as Amjamis’ eyes never left his. “I was just on my way to investigate something.” Jesus slowly nods, much like how Amjamis did. “I think you should do that if it has to do with what made Abraham seize.” Amjamis does a sarcastic American salute. As they turn their backs he extends his arm out, middle finger extended. MYS giggles. “And I’m the child here..”<br><br>“Do I even wanna know what you just got yourself into?” Amjamis turns around to see Arial, looking disappointed. “I think I got my point across.” Arial grabs his arm. “What? That you’re a jackass?” Amjamis shrugs, “I feel like the fact I’m not from here should cement that.” Arial gets closer, almost whispering. “I found something..” Arial slips Amjamis a magazine. Amjamis discreetly looks at it, seeing a bunch of lewd photos of women and advertisements. “I guess I shouldn’t be shocked..” Arial looks at him confused. Amjamis continues, “I mean.. I’m into men, you’re sort of my opposite in some ways, it makes sense you’re into women..” Arial snatches the magazine back. “No..! I found this in Abraham’s bedroom..!” Amjamis’ eyes widen, before going back to normal. “Actually.. Are you gay?” Arial scoffs, pulling him aside. MYS comes out. “Hey, I have a question..” They look at MYS. “Why are we putting so much energy towards this guy?” AMjamis gestures to him. “Y’know, I agree. My leg hurts and I’d rather be-” Arial interrupts Amjamis. “The both of you… Just.. If you want to help, help. If you’re just going to be angry and be assholes, then.. Just go away. Go on your own adventure, and I’ll fix this myself.” MYS and Amjamis stare at eachother. MYS smiles, perfectly content. Amjamis.. Has his usual expression. “I didn't find anything in the church, in the kitchen, or at his lighthouse outpost where he works. He made some really bad thing directed at God or something- it was really bad, really poorly written, but nothing that has to do with his illness.” He scratches the back of his head. “And all you found were porn magazines?” Arial nods. “I couldn't find anything else. There's literally nothing in the town that points to anything.”<br><br>Amjamis' eyes widen. “What? What is it, Amjamis?” Amjamis smiles. “MYS.. Are you up for a trip?” MYS’ turns to Amjamis, confused. “What? Are we gonna kill something?” Amjamis nods. “Yep.” Arial step in between MYS and Amjamis. “What? No! You’re not killing anyone here-” Arial stops speaking as Amjamis presses his index finger against her collarbone. “Who said I was killing a person?” The emphasis on the last word gave her a clue on what he was thinking, Amjamis’ finger drags from her collarbone to the forest, pointing at it. “I’m talking about out there.” Arial looks at the dark forest, it almost turns into a pitch-black void with subtle sparks of what seem to be lights that dim out as quickly as they appear. “Are you two sure?” Amjamis looks at the trees swaying in the wind. “If it brings us closer to finding whatever made Abraham seize.. Sure.” Arial nods. “Thank you.” Amjamis nods in response. MYS cackles excitedly “Yippee! I’ve been waiting for this!” Arial lets out a breathy chuckle as she sees MYS’ face glitch and melt under pure excitement. “You two be safe.. Okay?” Amjamis nods, and as he begins to walk away, he turns toward Arial one more time before leaving with a salute, running into the forest.</p>

        <p>Arial stood by herself, scanning the town for potential investigation spots before hearing a loud scream ring out. Arial runs towards the source seeing Abraham seize. She can’t help but smile as she sees Esther holding his head much like how she did before jumping in, holding him close as well. “Did anyone see anything?! What happened beforehand!?” Jesus gets up, as he had fallen down, stammering. “W-we were discussing plans, he was doing just fine then suddenly collapsed!” Esther nods, “There wasn’t anything out of the ordinary! Um.. Those flowers! They were close by!” Arial investigates the flowers. They were lotus flowers. “No, these aren’t the cause. They weren’t around when the 1st seizure happened, these aren’t pollinated, and the wind hasn't changed since the last one either.” Arial looks around nervously, not knowing what to do. Her eyes land on the last remnants of MYS and Amjamis walking into the forest, and she lets out a deep breath.<br><br>"Please hurry."</p>

        <p>MYS skips behind Amjamis humming a tune familiar to Amjamis. “So, Mr. Corpse.. Do you know why we’re saving this guy? You seemed to have a change of heart as soon as you saw how sad lil’ miss nurse became.” Amjamis sighs. “It’s best if we don’t make Arial upset, plus, it’s giving you an excuse to kill things so I don’t see why you’re complaining.” MYS giggles. “I’m not complaining, I’m just curious. Her judgement means alot to you, huh?” Amjamis looks at him. “Compared to yours? Yeah.” MYS lets out a fake, sad sigh. “Oh, how the mighty have fallen. From the king who could own the world.. To a mere pawn hellbent on redemption and love.” Amjamis groans. “Yeah, yeah, shut up.” Suddenly, a voice rings out. “You shouldn’t have come here.” Amjamis looks around, trying to find the source to no avail. “Yeah, well, we think you might be killing a guy, so..” The voice rings out. “We’re merely getting rid of the darkness. The sin in the world.” Amjamis groans. “Jeez, more religious shit? C’mon, give me a break.” The voice goes silent for just a moment, before continuing. “I sense great evil in the both of you.” MYS raises his hands. “Guilty as charged!” Amjamis sighs. “I did what I thought I had to.” The voice, almost circling the two says, “Evil is what makes this world truly rotten. It’s the mold that gets into every crevice and warps the foundations, making it crumble.” The voice seems to almost be entirely behind the two. “I need to fix this world.” MYS calls out, “Amjamis!” As a string knocks Amjamis to the ground, a spear gets shot, narrowly missing Amjamis as he says “Oh, shit..”</p>

        <p>MYS gets up before extending a string into the darkness, seemingly picking something up. Amjamis presses himself against MYS’ back, watching out for anyone else. MYS’ string retracts and he lets out a small sound of confusion. “Alot smaller than I thought..” Amjamis turns around to see a small pixie in MYS’ hold. “What the..?” The pixie speaks, it’s the same voice from before. “Let me go, you filth! I am Desmond, the remover of evil!” Amjamis looks around confused. “What in the Kentucky Fried Fuck am I looking at?” a very small pebble gets thrown at the back of Amjamis’ head. “Hey- what..?” Amjamis turns around to see another pixie. “Let them go! Now!” MYS’ hold tightens as he smiles more, the pixie squealing in pain. Amjamis rests his hand on MYS’ shoulder. MYS looks at Amjamis before letting go. “I’m free!” The pixie flies to the other one. “Now, we’ll kill you!” Amjamis looks at them tiredly. “Turns out.. This is the threat? You’ve gotta be kidding me..” The pixies look at eachother confused before looking back at them. “Aren’t you terrified?” MYS shakes his head, smiling. Amjamis gestures to them. “You’re the size of bouncy balls, MYS here almost squeezed one of you to death. The pixie proudly states, “I actually escaped his grasp.” Amjamis looks at it, annoyed. “No, he let go. Listen- I don’t wanna be here any longer than I have to, your voices give me more of a headache than his does.” MYS looks sad. “I assume you guys are what’s terrorizing the nearby town?” The pixies suddenly look angry as more of them emerge. “That town is full of a bunch of freaks!” MYS tilts his head. “What do you mean?” The pixie shouts. “They believe they are good-hearted people, serving their lord- they’re doing it all wrong!! They’re terrible! Awful! No-good!” Amjamis gets closer. “How are they doing it wrong?” The pixie smiles. “They believe in peace and harmony. God wouldn’t let sinners be! He would burn them! Make them rot! So that’s what we do.. We rot people from within for their sins.” One of the other pixies flies in. “But what’s up with you two?” Amjamis and MYS tilt their heads. “Usually, people would be dead by now by magic, or our magic would make us seem like terrifying beasts.” Amjamis looks at MYS confused. MYS shrugs.<br><br>The pixies look at MYS and Amjamis confused. “How are you defying our power?!” Amjamis and MYS shrug. “Listen, we’ll bounce and not tell anyone about this weird religious cess pool you got going on as long as you tell us if you’re behind Abraham’s seizures.” The pixie flies right up to Amjamis’ face. “We don’t regret what we do! We’ll slowly pick off that entire town!” Amjamis pushes them away. “I don’t care what you do, I just need a confirmation.” The pixies look around and at eachother. “I don’t think we owe you anything, your demons!” Amjamis takes a step back. “Woah, now MYS might be, but I’m not a demon.” MYS looks back at them, his skin now red. “I’m just a guy looking for answers. You got ‘em?” The pixie nods. “Yeah, we’re killing that guy. He has an unbearable sin, the worst we’ve ever seen. Usually we just kill people off through liver disease, stuff like that. But him.. Oh, no, we have to make it slow.” Amjamis’ eyebrow twitches. “What is his sin? What did he do?” The pixie puts a finger over their lip. “Pixie secrets!! None of your business! Especially not with that unholy weapon of yours!” Amjamis summons his cheesegrater. “This? It’s actually quite holy, you see?” Amjamis points out the holes as the pixie gives him an annoyed stare. “I meant your gun.” Amjamis’ eyes widened as he saw a gun on his belt. MYS’ eyes widened. “I completely forgot I gave you that!” Amjamis looked at MYS, shocked. “What!?” MYS nodded. “I stole it from the church! It was on the 2nd floor!” Amjamis bends down to his height. “And you didn’t think to tell me..!?” MYS shrugged. “I forgot! Besides, it only has 2 bullets.” Amjamis stands up, taking a deep breath. “Okay.. MYS. We’re heading back.” The pixie shouts, “Hey! Don’t you dare try and go saving him or.. Or you’ll regret it.” Amjamis just groans, walking away back to town. MYS climbs onto his back. “Just gonna let them be?” Amjamis looks at MYS, “I know you would’ve loved to kill them all, but.. It’s just not worth the energy.”</p>

        <p>As Amjamis and MYS enter the town once again Arial runs to them, hugging Amjamis tightly. Amjamis holds her. “Woah. Arial, is everything alright?” Arial looks panicked. “It’s getting bad. He’s had 2 seizures and he’s starting to lose control over his body.” Amjamis’ eyes widened. “Parts of his brain are shutting down due to the seizures.. They’re not just seizures. These are strokes..” Arial grabs his hand, leading him to the hospital. As they barge into the door, Abraham is passed out with only Jesus and the nurse present. Amjamis approaches Jesus. “I think we need to have a chat.” Jesus looks at Amjamis, slightly confused. “What? What did you find in the forest? Don’t you think we should tell everyone for transparency?” Amjamis doesn’t respond, he simply stares at Jesus in the eyes, gesturing out of the hospital before leaving. Arial looks at him confused. “I.. Jesus, you go see whatever he needs, I’ll stay here and make sure he’s alright, okay?” Jesus nods following Amjamis out of the hospital. Amjamis quickly invades Jesus’ personal space, getting really close to his ear before stating, “I know about the pixies.” Jesus looks at him, extremely confused. “What?” Amjamis looks at him, tilting his head. “The pixies. The ones in the forest.” Jesus looks at him still confused, stammering. Amjamis gets even closer, looking straight into his eyes. “Jesus. Did you know about the pixies?” Jesus closes his eyes before opening them, staring directly into Amjamis’. “No. No I did not.” Amjamis backs off, kicking a rock. “God fucking damn it..” Jesus grabs Amjamis by the shoulders. “Amjamis, what are you talking about, you mad man?!” Amjamis laughs. “Well, good news for you, you’re no longer a suspect, bad news, Abraham’s fucked.” Jesus takes a step back, shocked. “What.. What did you find? Pixies? Like.. No beasts or anything?” Amjamis responds, “They’re a bunch of hyper-religious pixies who think you’re doing.. Religion wrong. And they’re waiting for any of your people to commit a sin to excuse the fact they’re killing your people.” Jesus’ eyes widen beyond what he thought was possible. “They- what!?” Jesus looks down to the ground before his eyes snap back to Amjamis. “We need to do something, right? We can’t just let them be- but.. How are we going to fight against magic?” Amjamis shakes his head. “I don’t know. I mean.. Me and MYS could kill them all. Me and MYS are immune to their spells, I don’t know why, but we are.” Arial approaches. “I know why.” They look at her. “Well.. Why?” Amjamis asks.<br><br>Arial states, “It’s pretty simple. You and MYS are.. Very unholy. I wouldn’t say nearly as bad as.. What was it, pixies who kill people because they don’t agree? You’re not as bad as them to the core, but.. You’ve admittedly done worse.” Jesus looks at Amjamis, holding his hands close to his torso. She continues, “I think that.. ‘Evil’ that.. Experience you have within yourself, empowers you to the point when you’re immune to their type of evil.” Amjamis thinks for a moment. “Firstly, ow. Secondly, that actually makes perfect sense. Thirdly, where is MYS?” Jesus and Arial look around noticing MYS isn’t there anymore. “Oh no..” Arial calls out before Jesus speaks up, “Excuse me.. What is an MYS?” Amjamis and Arial look at him. “It’s.. A long story.”</p>

        <p>A little boy was looking up at a tree seeing a squirrel. “What’cha lookin’ at up there?” MYS asks. “That squirrel.” MYS looks at it. “Life is so interesting isn’t it?” The little boy looks at him, nodding happily. The little boy points at the squirrel, “I really want him. Too bad he never wants to come down.” MYS smiles, a string grabbing the squirrel hard, snapping its neck. He grabs the squirrel with his bare hands. The boy screams falling to the ground, crying. “What’s wrong? I thought you said you wanted the squirrel.” The little boy sobs and cries. “That was my friend..!” MYS tilts his head, holding the dead squirrel up to his face. “Oh. My bad! Here, let me bring him back.” The boy screams as he sees MYS stab a string into its back, blood seeping from the wound, the string retracts, the squirrel getting flung closer to the boy. The squirrel twitches before its body proportions stretch and enlarge. Its eyes are pure black beads with giant teeth that go halfway down to its chest. Its claws are long, black voids. The boy cries and sobs even more, covering his eyes. “C’mon! Look at him! He’s back!” The boy continues crying, “You’re mean! Stop it!! You killed him!” MYS sighs, before stabbing the squirrel once again, it lets out a shrill scream before falling limp and turning into a black puddle of goop that forms into a string that MYS absorbs. </p>

        <p>“MYS!!” Arial screams, running to the both of them. “What did you do to this boy!? Did you hurt him!?” MYS shakes his head. “No, he’s just a really bad communicator.” Amjamis sighs. The boy doesn’t respond, he just keeps crying and sobbing on the floor. Jesus approaches, seeing MYS for the first time in-person. MYS flies up his eyes black voids with white circles in him. His mouth leaking black goop as his arms and legs hang. “Well, Jesus.. Nice to meet you for realsies.” Jesus stumbles back. Amjamis says, “MYS, you’re awful at making introductions.” Jesus screams, “What is that?! That is..! That’s not a human!!” Amjamis grabs MYS by the back of his neck, like a cat. “Get up. This is MYS.” Jesus slowly stands. He steadily takes steps towards MYS, almost inspecting him like a foreign object. As Jesus’ body moves from the left and right, MYS’ eyes follow him, his head twitches, his jaw lags behind, almost wobbling as it clicks back into place. “I like the suit.” MYS says, Jesus looks down at himself, feeling exposed. “Uh.. Th-thank you.” Arial rests her hand on Jesus’ back. “Now that you two are acquainted, we need to find a way to stop the pixies.” Jesus slowly nods, picking up on speed. “Yeah.. Yeah.”<br><br>They discuss plans, all with many different upsides and downsides all the while MYS crawls around on the floor, making snide remarks, and pointing out the flaws and tribulations that would come along with some plans “I feel like we’re really hitting a steadfast here..” Amjamis says, admittedly. MYS jumps onto Jesus’ back, not able to hide within his shadow like he does with Amjamis, Jesus lets out a small yelp as Arial calls out, “MYS. Down. Get off of him.” MYS shakes his head like a defiant child. </p>

        <p>Amjamis groans, going over to MYS before hearing someone scream, “Get off of him!!” They look toward the scream, realizing it’s Abraham, he charges at MYS, punching him directly off of Jesus. Arial covers her mouth, and Amjamis looks genuinely surprised. Abraham’s breathing is intense as MYS gets up. Abraham kicks MYS once before being punched directly in the face by Amjamis. Abraham falls to the ground as Amjamis punches him once more, “Don’t you” he punches him again, “fucking dare”  he punches him again, “do that again!!” He punches him one last time before being pulled off of Abraham by Jesus. “All of you! Stop it!” Arial looks down at Abraham before running to MYS, holding him in her arms. “Oh my God..” MYS lets out a little sound before a chuckle. A chuckle that turns into laughter. Laughter that turns into pure, unadulterated, maniacal laughter. “Oh, you piece.. Wow!” MYS flies to Abraham. “You got some big ones on you, now don’t you?!” Amjamis steps nearly in between the two as MYS gets a good look at him. “You’re lucky you already got a beating.” MYS laughs once more as Arial regrabs him, “MYS, are you okay?” MYS wipes the black blood from his nose. “I'm just dandy..” He says before letting out a small chuckle. Amjamis grabs Abraham by his shirt. “What the hell was that?!” Jesus steps to Amjamis’ side, “Abraham, that was not warranted, you should be in bed.” Abraham, holds his head in pain. “I saw.. You were in danger, I just.. Wanted to protect you..” His voice is strained in pain. Amjamis’ expression softens as he more steadily holds Abraham. “Abraham? Do you have a headache?” Jesus gestures to him, “You probably gave him a concussion.” Amjamis scoffs, “I’m a slim Indian dude, you really think I could do that much damage?” Jesus looks at him, slightly surprised. “You’re Indian?” He nods. “Pale, and with an American accent, but yes.” Abraham falls to the ground, Amjamis catching him halfway down, fully expecting the worst, but Abraham doesn’t move. He lets out a few shallow breaths before Amjamis notes “He’s.. Not seizing. That’s good. I.. Shit..” Amjamis drags him back into the hospital, laying him down on the bed.</p>

        <p>Arial and Amjamis sit by his bed, Arial looking at Amjamis and saying “Look at you.” She smiles slightly as Amjamis looks back at her. “What?” He asks as she says “You’re showing that you care. I’m proud of you.” Amjamis sighs, wanting her to shut up. Amjamis suddenly hugs Arial and says, “I’m sorry..” softly. Arial pats his on the back, taking his head underneath hers. “I know you aren’t a big fan of these people, but I’m happy you’re trying your best-” Amjamis interrupts her, still speaking softly, “No, I’m sorry because.. Your cake is most definitely fucking burnt.” Arial lets out a genuine laugh before saying, “I love you.” Amjamis’ smile drops. Arial looks at him, “Oh, was that.. Too much? I didn’t-” Amjamis’ eyebrows furrowed, he wasn’t even looking at Arial anymore. He was processing. The poem, the magazine, everything. As Abraham starts to wake up, Amjamis laughs. “Amjamis, what’s wrong?” Amjamis stands, perfectly straight. “I know what’s wrong.”</p>

        <p>Arial’s eyes widen and Jesus enters the room. “Did you say that you might know what’s wrong?” Amjamis can barely keep in his laughter, even MYS seems intrigued. Amjamis looks down at Abraham, the man who can barely speak, who can barely move. His eyes widen as Amjamis’ pierces through his. “I diagnose you with.. A dick in your ass.” Everyone stumbles back, Arial says, “Amjamis, this is no time for your jokes..!” Amjamis remains perfectly straight. “Sorry, correction, you want a dick in your ass.” Abraham’s eyes widen and everyone looks around confused. “May I ask for everyone to leave the room, please?” Jesus stands up. “Are you going to elaborate on what you mean?” Amjamis looks at Abraham before stating, “I don’t think you’ll want me to while you’re here.” Jesus stays. “I wanna hear what’s wrong with him.” Amjamis sighs, throwing his hands up. “He’s gay!” Arial’s eyes widen, Jesus takes a step back, pressing against the wall, MYS laughs on the floor, Esther covers her mouth. A loud silence covers the room. Jesus recuperates himself. “I.. I need to go..” Jesus leaves the room, leaving everyone else there in the room.<br><br>Esther approaches Amjamis, “Wh-what proof do you have for.. Any of that?!” Amjamis gestures to Abraham. “Just look at him! Let’s see here, both times he had a seizure, they were in close proximity to Jesus meaning an emotional reaction was the cause of the seizures, we found porn magazines which means he was trying to brainwash himself into thinking he likes melons instead of cucumbers, he was refusing himself, and then his emotional outlash to seeing a child simply bothering him. Abraham didn’t know about MYS’ evilness or his power, to Abraham, MYS was.. Just a kid. He would’ve done that to anyone which means he is willing to go to jail for that man which strengthens my first point. Further questions?” Arial sits down and Esther stumbles back much like how Jesus did. “So.. What now?” Esther asks as Amjamis turns to Abraham. “Wanna confirm it for us?” Abraham could barely speak, tears fall from his face as he tries recoiling back into the bed farther, like there’s some sort of exit, but there’s nothing. Nowhere to go. “I-I’m not gay..! I’m not gay!” Arial grabs Abraham’s hand, “Hey. It doesn’t matter if you are-” Abraham hits her hand away. “It does matter! How can I be apart of something-” He chokes back a sob, “It’s stupid! It’s.. Fuck!” Amjamis’ smile goes away and says “It is stupid. But it’s something built into us all from birth. Guess God didn’t like you.” He cries, trying to look away. Esther leaves the room as well, leaving Arial, MYS, and Amjamis. Amjamis extends his hand. “I say we go on a walk.” Abraham stares at Amjamis. “C’mon, I’m not gonna punch you again.” Abraham looks at Arial and she nods. Abraham gets up and follows Amjamis out of the hospital.</p>

I believe in Amjamis, I do.” She takes a step back. “Well, what do we do now?” Jesus wipes a tear before clearing his throat, staring directly at the woods. “We.. We find out how to save Abraham, and then..” He chokes back a sob. Esther looks to him, “Are we.. Going to exile him..? We’ve never dealt with something like this and-” Jesus interrupts her. “We’re accepting him. Who.. Who cares if he’s gay?! He’s a good man- he works hard, he loves this community, and loves God, he has come to every sermon, every meeting with a smile on his face with a devotion stronger than almost anyone here! I don’t care if he’s gay- he’s my best friend! I don’t care if he loves me, he is still Abraham!” Jesus’ voice was shaky. He could barely stand still. Esther nods. “I.. I understand. I even agree. Abraham is a good man, and we shouldn’t let his preferences obscure that. But.. How do you think he’ll react when he realizes.. We’re together?” Jesus shakes his head, “I don’t know- I mean, we haven’t told anyone. I didn’t even tell Arial.” She sits down taking a deep breath.</p>

        <p>“And my Dad found out about the whole.. Crossdressing thing and sent me here as a kid. I never went back.” Abraham explains, looking at Amjamis. “So, your Dad was a homophobe, huh? Guess the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.” Abraham responds, “I.. I just didn’t want it to be true for the sake of.. Not making things awkward. Or weird.” Amjamis softly chuckles. “What was realizing it like? You just saw him one day and went ‘oh fuck?’” Abraham softly laughs in response. “Pretty close.. I was just.. Really scared, mostly. About what it meant for our relationship.” Amjamis looked at him with a slight smile, “Didn’t you worry about going to hell or something?” Jesus nods, “I did, a little, I guess.. But.. He meant more to me than eternal damnation.” Amjamis’ eyes slightly widen. “He must mean alot to you.” Jesus nods. “I.. Assume you don’t believe in an afterlife?” Amjamis shakes his head, “Nope. When I was a kid, around.. 7, I always thought that God did exist, but that he had left..” Jesus’ expression turns to one of sadness as Amjamis continues, “And then I grew older and.. I lost 2 people and it.. Broke me. Gave me alot more time to think, and I just.. I didn't care. I don’t think God exists.” Jesus looks at him. “I imagine your sexuality is alot easier to grapple with.” Amjamis smiles once again, chuckling. “I mean.. Y’get the occasional asshole here n’ there, but I mostly have fun with them. People who don’t understand it, kids who act like 2 men being together is some new cosmic idea.” The both of them laugh. Abraham asks, “With these.. Seizures and stroaks.. Are they going to stop now?” Amjamis looks at him. “We’ll have to test it. You’ve already lost a lot of control of your body, you can barely walk.. It’s.. A risk, but one we’re gonna find out either way” Jesus nods. “If the seizures and strokes don’t stop.. I have a favor. a really big one, but.. One I think you’ve done before.” Amjamis looks at him slightly confused as Abraham leans into his ear whispering. Amjamis’ expression remains the same, simply staring at him, and nodding. “Not just for Jesus, but for you.” He responds. Abraham nods. “Thank you.”</p>

Kill the pixies?” Arial asks, as MYS smiled. “I like that idea. Alot. But.. You don’t know how magic works, do you?” Arial tilts her head slightly. MYS continues, “They’re not making him seize by a press of a button, it’s a function. Even if we kill every pixie in that forest.. The spell won’t wear off. At least, that’s how my magic works.” He yawns tiredly nuzzling into Arial. Arial strokes his hair, thinking. “So.. Is there anything we can do?” She asks. MYS simply makes a sound of disagreement, still smiling. Arial looks at the cross on the wall and frowns, almost angrily. Amjamis, Jesus, and Esther all enter the room at the same time. Abraham and Jesus’ eyes meet and a silence follows. Jesus presses forward, hugging Abraham. “You’re.. Still here?” Abraham asks, Jesus responds, “Of course I am.. You’re my best friend..” Amjamis keeps a careful eye out, and before he knows it, he grabs Jesus and pulls him away from Abraham as he starts seizing once more. “Son of a..” Amjamis pins him to the hospital bed, and waits it out as Jesus cries into Esther’s arm and Arial keeps track of vitals as MYS lies around Amjamis’ neck like a ferret.</p>

She slightly laughs, stretching her legs. They walk to the hospital and see Esther outside, pacing. Arial asks, “Esther, what’s wrong?” Esther looks at them. “It.. Jesus didn’t come home last night. He’s spent the entire night with Abraham. Amjamis nods, “That’s his best friend. Even if they like you, you never abandon your best friend in a time of need. You stick with them through day and night, both figuratively and literally at times.” Esther nods. “I know, I’m just.. Stressed. I’m worried about Abraham, really, but I don’t want Jesus getting hurt.” Arial nods, and the three of them enter. “Well, you’re not gonna have to worry about Abraham any longer. We had a talk last night actually.” Abraham looks at Amjamis with a thankfulness in his eyes. Jesus gets up, Arial tilts her head, and Esther perks up. “I might’ve found a way to save Abraham, but it requires taking him back to our place for just a bit.” Arial sits down, “Wait, really?” Amjamis looks at her and nods, but as she looks at his fingers.. He presses his middle finger on the table, then his index, a short pause then presses his middle finger three times. She looks at him, confused, but trusts him. Jesus almost jumps in excitement, “That’s great!” Abraham says, “And hey.. They told me I could send letters from their place, so we’ll stay in touch!” Jesus smiles. Esther hugs Abraham. “Oh, I’m so glad.. I don’t know what we’d do if we ever truly lost you..” Abraham gets up, grabbing onto Amjamis’ shoulder. “I think.. It’s time.” Amjamis looks at him, nodding. MYS wakes up instantly running quickly and onto Amjamis’ back like a measuring tape recoiling. Arial says “Hey-” Amjamis interrupts Arial. “Don’t worry, he’s fine.” Abraham and Jesus give their final goodbyes, Arial, MYS, Amjamis, and Abraham walking near the forest.</p>

Abraham hands Amjamis a stack of letters to send the town. “I dated them for convenience.” Amjamis nods. “Arial, you go home first.. Me and MYS will join back.

They make it to a well. Amjamis says, “This seems like a good spot.” Abraham nods, sitting at the edge of it. He lets out a quiet sob, asking “I know what’s coming, why am I..?” Amjamis starts walking around the well. “It’s because you’re scared. It’s okay to be scared.” Abraham continuously nods. “Do you.. Do you think I’ll make it into heaven?” Amjamis sighs, stopping behind Abraham. “C’mon, man, you know I don’t believe in any of that crap..” Abraham lets out a choked sob, tears streaming down his face. “But.. If.. If there is a heaven. If God is real.. You’re making it in. You’re a good man, Abraham. You shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age.” Abraham smiles, looking up at the sky. Amjamis says, “I’m sorry.” as a loud gunshot rings through the forest and Abraham falls in-front of the well. He stands there for quite a while before looking up at the sky, feeling himself fade back into the living room.</p>

        <p>MYS giggles and drops to the ground, crawling up the trees, jumping from tree to tree, looking. Searching. As he finally finds the town belonging to the pixies he smiles. “Abraham.. He’s.. Dead, apparently?” Another pixies speaks up, “Good! Now it’s time to infect the rest of them! Just wait for them to slip up-” A loud crash rings out as MYS roars, his giant form crushing entire homes. A string wipes out the entire village of pixies, tearing the foundation from the ground and tearing down entire trees. Pixies scream as strings protrude from the ground, tearing them limb by limb. Blood soak into the drywall, splattering across the family photos. Screams tore out, families looking for their kids, babies being left abandoned, until.. It all stopped. MYS walks around, seeing the crumbled homes in the massive ditch, the smell of new blood infiltrating his senses, making him almost giggle in euphoria. decreasing in size as he picks up a tiny cheesegrater a pixie must’ve made. “I’ve always hated Christians..” MYS fades into the living room.</p>
